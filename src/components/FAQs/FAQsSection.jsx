          question: "What are the operational cost differences between conventional and 3D concrete printing?",
          answer: "Operational costs in concrete 3D printing are generally lower than conventional construction (by around 25-28%) due to reduced labor, minimal material waste, and faster build times, but may include higher energy consumption, specialized material costs, and maintenance expenses."

        {
          question: "How do cost savings in formwork impact the overall budget in 3D printing?",

          answer: "Layer by layer deposition of material along the design path of a component/part leads to final part creation. This method falls under additive manufacturing process and is also referred to as 3D Printing.

          question: "What are the ways in which Concrete 3D Printing can add value in existing construction activity?",
          answer: `3D Printing adds value to construction activity in the following ways:

Design Phase:
• File generation for 3D Printing is done post confirmation of Structural, MEP layouts which reduces the time taken for site execution

Site Execution:
• Lesser no. of critical path deviations during project execution since all of the layouts are approved before project execution reducing no.of changes post approval

Skilled Labour dependency:
• Automating processes reduces the need for skilled labour required to finish specific part of the activities thereby reducing delays involved in project execution

Integrated Finishing with minimal plastering:
• 3D Printed Surface finish reduces the need for final surface finishing, thereby reducing the material and time required for finishing activities
• Pre-planned MEP positions and conduits, reducing integration time post 3D Printing activity completion`

        {
          question: "What are the ways in which Concrete 3D Printing can replace processes or entire steps in existing construction schedules?",
          answer: `Construction activity has the following phases:
• Site Clearance and Excavation
• Foundation
• Superstructure buildup
• Walls construction
• Plastering
• MEP cutting and laying
• Re-plastering and Final finishing

The above activities can be coupled with introduction of concrete 3D Printing, thereby reducing the no. of individual contractors involved in a project for completion and encouraging activity completion in parallel during Superstructure build up works`

          question: "What are the disadvantages of Concrete 3D Printing?",
          answer: "Current Disadvantages of Concrete 3D Printing requires knowledge transfer to existing conventional contractors leading to delays in large scale adoption. Tvasta is currently support with Codes development for 3D Printing, which will bridge the gap for approvals needed for construction of a 3D Printed building"
        },
        {
          question: "Is concrete 3d printing sustainable and what is the lifetime of the building?",
          answer: "Concrete 3D Printing uses sustainable material mix for execution, where embodied carbon emissions are lesser than that used in conventional buildings. The lifetime of concrete 3D Printed buildings is at least 50 years. Additionally, the Design process with 3D Printing incorporates Net Zero Design feasibility with ease, bridging the gap required for general construction buildings to consider this aspect."
        },
        {
          question: "Can 3D Printed buildings tolerate all weather conditions?",
          answer: "Material Design is important when factoring in design for harsh weather conditions - primarily cold weather conditions. 3D Printing has the additional benefit of providing provisions for insulation material in the hollow cavities thereby reducing the need for separate insulation panels in cold weather conditions."

        {
          question: "Columns and Beams - How are they integrated with Concrete 3D Printing?",
          answer: "Hollow walls/pockets in 3D Printed buildings are used to place columns which reduce the requirement of formwork and promote quicker execution of the superstructure portion. Roofing is done either in the form of pre-cast slabs or cast-insitu method based on the site location and nature of available resources for execution"

          answer: "Both the critical activities are currently done conventionally, integrated into the project execution process with 3D Printing. Tvasta has plans to intervene in the roofing part of the building in the upcoming year to reduce the overall requirement of skilled labour and machinery needed to execute this activity."

          question: "How different is 3D Printing when compared to LGSF in terms of execution and type of material used?",
          answer: "Light Gauge Steel Forming (LGSF) requires a formwork in a fixed shaped into which the concrete material is poured using a concrete mixer. 3D Printing process uses a 3D Printer which lays concrete in a layer by layer fashion - where design can be varied based on the client design requirement"
